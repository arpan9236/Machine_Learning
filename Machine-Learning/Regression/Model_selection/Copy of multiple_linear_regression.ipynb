We have learnt total 6 regression models: (i) Simple linear regression, (ii) Multiple linear regression, (iii) Polynomial linear regression, (iv) Support vector regression, (v) Decision tree regression and (vi) Random forest regression.\n","\n","Here we have made the codes of the above models as general as possible so that if we want to apply these models to any future dataset we have to change very minimal in the codes. In fact, here the code templates are so generic that we just have to change the name of the dataset!!!\n","\n","At the end of each code, we will evaluate the performance of the trained model trained on the given datset so that we can easily compare the performances of the models and choose the best one. So, we can select the best model for a new dataset in a short amount of time and very efficiently using the code templates.  \n","\n","So the answer to the question: \"How should I select the best model?\" The simple answer is try all the models and select the best one which have best performance result which is measured by $R^2$ or adjusted $R^2$. The metric $R^2$ is given by:\n","\n","$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$ ,\n","\n","where $SS_{res} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$ is the residual sum of squares and $SS_{tot} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$ is the total sum of squares. $y_i = $ actual/true value of the dependent variable, $\\hat{y}_i = $ predicted value of the dependent variable by the regression model, $\\bar{y} = $ mean or average of all the true values of the dependent variable.\n","\n","The $R^2$ is used in evaluating the goodness of a regression fit.\n","\n","We have not included the simple linear regression model as now we have real world dataset having several features. SLR is possible only when there is only one feature.\n","\n","The requrement for a minimal change in the code templates is that\n","\n","(i) dataset is a csv format,\n","\n","(ii) Features are in the left columns and dependent variable vector is at the last (most right) column.\n","\n","(iii) Dataset has no missing values (missing values can be handled by data preprocessing tools we leanrt) and no categorical data."],"metadata":{"id":"_Wqu9tEJWnUU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# About the Dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"lCW-63SUgrp3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now we will use a real world dataset **'Data.csv'** which has 4 features and 1 dependendent variable.
