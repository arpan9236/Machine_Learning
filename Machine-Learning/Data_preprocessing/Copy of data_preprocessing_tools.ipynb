scaling to ensure that values of all the features are in the same scale. We do this so as to prevent one feature to dominate the other, which therefore would be neglected by the ML model. In order to avoid some features to be dominated by other features in such a way that the dominated features are not even considered by the ML model.\n","\n","Feature scaling is not necessary for all the ML models, even if the features are taking very different values. e.g., in the multiple linear regression model, $y = b_0 + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + ... + b_N X_N$. If some variables ($X_i$) take much higher variables than others, when learning the coefficients the coeifficients will just compensate by taking small values for the variables that take higher values.\n","\n","The main two feature scaling methods are: (i) Standardization and (ii) Normalization, which make all the features in the same scaling.\n","\n","In Standardization, all the values of each column are subtracted by the mean value of all the values of that column and then divided by the standard deviation of all the values of that column: $X_{stand} = \\frac{X - X_{mean}}{\\sigma}$. This will put all the values in the range\n","around [-3, 3].\n","\n","In normalization, all the values of each column are subtracted by the minimum value of that column and then divided by the difference between maximum value and minumum value of that column: $X_{norm} = \\frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}$. So, both the numerator and denominator are positive and the denominator is always $\\ge$ the numerator. Therefore all the values in this transformation become in the range [0, 1].\n","\n","Now the popular question in Data Science community is, should we go for Normalization or Standardization? Normalization is recommended when you have normal distribution in most of your features. Standardization actually works well for all the time. Therefore it is better to go with standardization.\n","\n","Now we have 4 things: two matrices of features ($X_{train}$ and $X_{test}$) and two dependent variable vectors ($y_{tain}$ and $y_{test}$). So, feature scaling will be applied after the train-test splitting and only on $X_{train}$ and $X_{test}$, seperately. As $X_{test}$ is supposed to be completely new data to the ML model, for standardization of $X_{test}$ we will use the $X_{mean}$ and $\\sigma$ of the $X_{train}$.  \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"P3-pNfxgGjNe"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AxjSUXFQqo-3"},"source":["# StandardScaler class perform the standardization on both X_train and X_test.\n","\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","sc = StandardScaler()   # Create the object of the StandardScaler class.

The answer is: no, we will not apply feature scaling to the dummy variables. The goal of standardization is to make all the values of all the features in the same scale. Here the dummy variables already have values in the range [-3, 3]. In fact, standardization will make the dummy variables even worse as we will lose the information of which country corresponds to which encoded value. We will get nonsense numerical values and we will be uncapable to say which tuple of 3 values correspond to which country. We will totally lose  the interpretation and besides this won't improve the training performance.
