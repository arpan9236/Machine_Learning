Here, I have build and trained various Machine Learning (ML) models which I have learnt from Udemy ML course (Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024]). I have written codes on data preprocessing, various regression models like Simple linear regression, Multiple linear regression, Polynomial linear regression, Support vector regression, Decision tree regression, and Random forest regression, Classification models like Logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, Support vector machine (SVM), kernel-SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision tree classification, Random forest classification, Classification model selection, Evaluating classification models, Unsupervised learning: K-Means clustering. I have also compared these models and shown how to choose the best regression model. I have completed the course upto this portion. Currently I am learning the other ML topics and models. I will update the codes for other ML models as I finish learning topics.
