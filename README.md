Here, I have built and trained various Machine Learning (ML) models which I have learnt from Udemy ML course (Course name: Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024]. Instructors: Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves). 

I have written codes on:

(1) **Data Preprocessing**, and used 

(2) **Regression models**(Supervised Learning): Simple linear regression, Multiple linear regression, Polynomial linear regression, Support vector regression, Decision tree regression, and Random forest regression. I also did Model evaluation and compared these models and shown how to choose the best regression model based on some metrics.

(3) **Classification models** (Supervised Learning): Logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, Support vector machine (SVM), kernel-SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision tree classification, Random forest classification, Classification model selection, Evaluating classification models using some metrics. 

(4) **Unsupervised learning**: K-Means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, 

(5) **Association Rule Learning**: Apriori and Eclat models

to solve various business problems and case studies. 

I have completed the course upto this portion. Currently I am learning the other ML topics and models. I will update the codes for other ML models as I finish learning topics.
